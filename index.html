							<h1>About Me</h1>

							<p>Growing up in a Chinese household, the default mode of thinking was to work hard and be well-educated. And so I did; I worked hard to earn my way to Berkeley. There I studied Biology with the intent of pursuing the medical field, but only to realize later that it was not a good fit for me.</p>

							<p>What led me to pursue a career in web development all started when I was working at Philips as a drafter/designer. I with a web developer who always managed to simplify and make more efficient the way I worked with our software tool. I was intrigued by how much she could help me by applying some codes, and immediately that sparked an interest in my desire to delve deeper into web development.</p>
